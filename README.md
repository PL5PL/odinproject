Time to set up the 2nd project. I'll import recipes later.

Ok, got through the rest of the exercises, but it was a bit of a doozy. I had
to look at the solutions because the flexbox ideas aren't super fluid to me
at the moment. I still need to go through more practice. Next up is the project
for this, which I'll start opening up on this as a GitHub page.

Got through foundations/flex:
            04-flex-information
            05-flex-modal

Still not very confident without looking up the solutions. 04 was okay, but
I had some unnecessary CSS in it. 05, I was just stumped. The changes make
sense one by one. I read a bit of JWC's flexbox blog, which has a lot of detail
about this layout algorithm with CSS.

Working on foundations-alignment today.

Today, I worked on flex froggy. I thought the website game was neat. I'll link it here: [flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com).

I'm not sure what the point of learning this is, but I guess it's good for page layout stuff.

Today I'll be covering the Flexbox on TOP.

This is about the way to move elements around on a web page.

I went over the "Interneting Is Hard" tutorial : [over here](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/flexbox/index.html)

I'll use this as a brief log on things I've worked on with the Odin Project.

I'll be going backwards as my prior attempt at this was both private and a while ago. Hopefully by the end of the year I'll get through most of the material.
