# Odin Project

Today, I worked on flex froggy. I thought the website game was neat. I'll link it here: [flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com).

I'm not sure what the point of learning this is, but I guess it's good for page layout stuff.

Today I'll be covering the Flexbox on TOP.

This is about the way to move elements around on a web page.

I went over the "Interneting Is Hard" tutorial : [over here](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/flexbox/index.html)

I'll use this as a brief log on things I've worked on with the Odin Project.

I'll be going backwards as my prior attempt at this was both private and a while ago. Hopefully by the end of the year I'll get through most of the material.
